# React Project Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (for repository)

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dyjudealexis/web-admin-philtrust-bank.git

   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

## Running the Application

To start the development server:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm build`: Builds the app for production.
